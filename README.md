# Ecomp-FPGA
Accelerating Image Processing Algorithms with Microblaze Softcore and Digilent S3 FPGA Demonstration Board.

Using a MicroBlaze to receive data from a Camera and displaying it through a VGA driver. In a first approach, we developed an software image processing application where was created an histogram of the image followed by the image embossing. 
An histogram is a graphical distribution of information and the checksum for each value. In this case we created the histogram to show the occurences of each level of grey (pixel). 
Image embossing was used to "perfect" the original image by highlithing light/dark grey pixels. 

Material necessary:
* Microblaze Softcore and Digilent S3 FPGA Demonstration Board
* Xilinx ISE and Embedded Development Kit (EDK) tools, version 10.1.03


Project developed with João Bauto and Robert Serrão.
